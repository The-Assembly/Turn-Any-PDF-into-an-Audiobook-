# Turn-Any-PDF-into-an-Audiobook-
In this session, we'll show you how to use Python to automagically turn a PDF into an audiobook, without anyone needing to read the contents out loud to procure the audio. To achieve this, we'll use a few separate Python libraries—namely Pyttsx3 (for speech to text) and PyPDF2 (to parse PDF files)—and show you how to put it all together to obtain downloadable audio from your PDF input in a single command. We'll also demonstrate how you can customize this process to modulate output voice and speed. This technique can easily be then further refined for nuances of text and speech using other libraries and programming (including NLP/machine learning-based ones)  Prerequisites: —Python (https://www.python.org/downloads/) —Visual Studio Code (https://code.visualstudio.com/download) -----------------------------------------  To learn more about The Assembly’s workshops, visit our website, social media or email us at workshops@theassembly.ae  Our website: http://theassembly.ae Instagram: http://instagram.com/makesmartthings Facebook: http://fb.com/makesmartthings Twitter: http://twitter.com/makesmartthings  #Python #Tutorial
